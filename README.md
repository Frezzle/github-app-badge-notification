## Setup

1. Install the extension from Chrome Web Store.
2. Add GitHub as an app. You can do so by following [this guide](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/3060053?hl=en). **Make sure to select the option "open as a window".**
3. Open the app.

## Cross-platform support

The badge should work with MacOS, Windows and many phone browsers, however it doesn't work on Linux (apparently). More details [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/How_to/Display_badge_on_app_icon).
